# About me

Currently I am working as a Full Stack Developer.

My ambitions lie further than simply writing a good code to get good money. I want to help people get things that improve their lives and make commercially successful products.

First I got to know about computers and robotics in my home country Belarus when I was 8.

Studying in the international environment in Poland I realized all power behind programming and started to feel interested about IT industry.

Though, I didn't start learning it properly and confined only to the SQL, CSS, HTML, and simple data analysis.

After relocating to Moscow I found myself eager to change professional area to Information Technologies
and start career from the scratch.

Now I do both Backend & Fronted for high load enterprise platforms and going to deepen my knowledge
about best web practices in order to create the best experience for Internet users.

Thank you for reading.

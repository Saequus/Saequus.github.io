You need to neither remember nor know everything. Use knowledge available in social sources like websites, news feeds, social media and directly from friends and connections.   

All these options may be considered trivial. Though, it's always useful to have them by hand. In case of a hurry and a limited time for preparations it might help returning to this list while checking possible visit locations.

Ask directly:

1. With the help of Instagram stories

Find events on social media:

1. [Couchserfing][couchserfing] to find free or almost free local events. It helped me many times during short stays at the Saint Petersburg, Warsaw and Moscow.
2. [Facebook events][facebook-events] are a good option for those who seak for both educational master classes and joyful perfomances.

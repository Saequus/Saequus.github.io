You need to neither remember nor know everything. Use knowledge available in social sources like websites, news feeds, social media and directly from friends and connections.   

All these options may be considered trivial. Though, it's always useful to have them by hand. In case of a hurry and a limited time for preparations it might help returning to this list while checking possible visit locations.

### Ask directly:

1. With the help of [Instagram][instagram] stories

### Find events on social media

1. [Couchserfing][couchserfing] to find free or almost free local events. It helped me many times during short stays at the Saint Petersburg, Warsaw and Moscow.
2. [Facebook events][facebook-events] are a good option for those who seak for both educational master classes and joyful perfomances.
3. Telegram client application allows searching amoung many public chats and channels. It allows you to ask questions in chats and get information directly from well-known people, who post valuable pieces of advice there. It is all about how deep you can dive in communicating and retriving usefull knowledge for yourself.

### Check data aggregators

By data aggregators I mean any website, which gathers information of certain topic and publishes (aggregates) it in a convenient way. 

Most known are travel, booking, and ticket-selling aggregators. But there are more of them. Look for something similar to "events near ..." or "where to go in ...", and usually best options are amoung of the feed of one of these data aggregators.

Examples are numerous, check [Timeout feed for London][london-timeout-feed] and [Joburg feed][johannesburg-feed].

### Secret groups, social clubs and communities

There are several secret groups on Facebook, secret channgels and chats in Telegram, social life meeting gathering in libraries, and gentlemen clubs taking tense discussions at universities, etc. All of them unite people of the same interests under and a roof of comfortable event organization. Being in one of these groups allows benefiting from its internal events, access to special occasions and events. 

The interests uniting people in these social clubs are various and sometimes extreme. Actually, they could be as harmfull as benefitial to you. It is up to you to decide whether to join or not.

Hovewer, it is not easy to get invited to since the reason for joining a community have to be a desire to give rather then a will to profit from. Although, every community craves fresh blood flowing in veins of vigorous newcommers. 

Start being active and ask about clubs in the area, it may help you take most from the social capital.
